            Dear Hiring Team,
            <br />
            <br />I am writing to express my interest in the Paid Media/SEM
            Specialist position. With a career deeply rooted in digital
            marketing and a proven track record of fostering growth and
            innovation using emerging technologies, I am itching to jump on new
            and exciting projects.
            <br />
            <br />I am a marketer who codes – I don’t just know my way around
            consoles and dashboards, but I have actively developed cutting edge
            tools for AI, automation and customer data optimisation to get users
            where they want to be and foster conversions that matter to the
            business. My journey through the digital landscape has been
            comprehensive, beginning with foundational roles in operations,
            through campaign marketing in digitally focused teams, and then as
            the Digital Experience Lead where I owned the end-to-end journey of
            our users and managed the go-to-market strategy. I got my hands on
            the tools and went on to become the Artificial Intelligence
            Architect at Te Pūkenga, New Zealand’s emerging super-polytech,
            where I designed mar-tech solutions in the most ambitious digital
            transformation project the NZ public sector had ever undertaken.
            <br />
            <br />I used predictive behavioural models to strategise, develop
            and deliver campaign experiences that converted at 12%. We worked
            with a lot of stakeholders to get the research right, and I have
            been immensely proud of the results we’ve gotten from determinedly
            keeping the user at the centre.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is all to say I am incredibly passionate about digital
            campaigns and products and have endeavoured to be on the bleeding
            edge of what’s possible everywhere I’ve gone.
            <br /> <br />
            In these roles, I've honed my expertise in managing large-scale
            digital campaigns, leveraging tools like Google Ads, and harnessing
            the analytical power over data to drive decision-making and campaign
            refinement. My experience aligns seamlessly with the skills you
            require, with the additional bonus that I, from PPC/SEM and SEO
            campaign management to the in-depth use of Google's suite for
            maximising campaign performance.
            <br />
            <br />
            In your search for a candidate who is not just experienced but also
            passionately invested in driving tangible results, I believe my
            background in leveraging technology for strategic marketing
            initiatives makes me a compelling fit. I am looking forward to the
            possibility of discussing how my skills, experience, and visions
            align with your client.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for considering my application. Coffee’s on me when you’re
            free to discuss.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
